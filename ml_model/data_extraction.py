# Data extraction
# This script connects to MongoDB database and create a labled data
# Workflow:
# - Connects to MongoDB: extract chakraassessments and appointments
# - Links them together by email to create conversion labels
# - Transforms data into features that ML models can understand
# - Save to csv file for model training
